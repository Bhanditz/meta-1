# [meta]
A framework.

## What is [meta]?
[meta] is a framework for building tech startups using Clojure(Script).

## Why [meta]?
We built [meta] out of the idea that a single framework could be used to build a startup. We named it [meta] as a reminder that software does not take any single form and, like a startup should continuously evolve.

## [meta] Internals
[meta] is written in Clojure(Script) and built using: 
- [x] [Boot][1] - Build tooling for Clojure.
- [x] [Hoplon][2] - ClojureScript Web Framework.
- [x] [Feathers.js][3] - An open source REST and realtime API layer for modern applications.
- [x] [Node.js][4] - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [x] [Electron][5] - Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- [x] [Atom][6] - A hackable text editor for the 21st Century.
