# [meta]
A _ framework.

## What is [meta]?
[meta] is a framework for building apps that can do anything.

## Why [meta]?
We built [meta] out of the idea that a single framework could be used to build a startup. We named it [meta] as a reminder that software does not take any single form and, like a startup should continuously evolve.

## [meta] Internals
[meta] is built using Clojure(Script) for Node.js/Electron and wraps many common libraries such as Hoplon and Feathers.js.
